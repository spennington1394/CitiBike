# CitiBike

Project uses python pandas library and Tableau.

Data: Monthly CitiBike share data from 2020.

User will need to open zip files.  Tableau does not allow you to publish worksheets, dashboards, or stories with over 15 million data points.  I was unable to publish the merged csv because GitHub only allows files that are 100MB or smaller in size.  

 Analysis shows a map of filtered stations for top and bottom starting and ending stations for CitiBike.  On the tooltip you will be able to see the total ride break down by quarter for each station.  The stations are colored by total trips for the year.  The map shows zip code boundaries, and has a layer showing 2018 census data displaying the median household income per zip code.  Please note that the bottom start and end stations are all located in Brooklyn and note the median income of the areas v top start and end stations.  
 
 Also notice that when you remove the filtered top and bottom stations and select all in the drop down on each dashboard how the CitiBike share is expanding.  If you navigate to the top of the map by the Bronx you can see all of the new stations that were added in middle and end of 2020. 
 
 Next Analysis shows a dashboard of riders gender and age.  The gender visualization is broken down by month.  The age visualization shows the age of users and the type of pass used.  Note how the passholders with 24hr or 3day ride the bikes for longer periods of time then subscription users.  
 
 Working on reformating data to allow to be published to Tableau Public for easier access. Enjoy!
